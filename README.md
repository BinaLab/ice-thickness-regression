# ice-thickness-regression

Training: `thickness_regression.py`

Inference or prediction: `inference.py`

Plots and models will be saved in the `model_out` folder. Outputs will be generated in the `out` folder.

After running `inference.py`, thickness estimates for each input image will be generated as `.txt` files inside the `out` folder. Use `out/create_df.csv` to generate a `.csv` which would be easier to comprehend.
